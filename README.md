## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>What can I yank to the clipboard?</strong></summary>


| Buffer Type        | Details |
|--------------------|---------|
| Default Buffers    | The current file is copied to the clipboard. You may also yank the current file into an archive (ending in `.nvim.zip`) which gets copied to your clipboard. This can then be pasted into other applications such as Slack, Discord, and your file browser.|
| Directory Buffers  | All files and folders in the current directory are copied to the clipboard. You may also yank all files and folders in the current directory into an archive (ending in `.nvim.zip`) which gets copied to your clipboard. These can then be pasted into other applications such as Slack, Discord, and your file browser.|
| Other Applications | Files and folders, images, svg source code, archives, and web URIs (such as from your web browser). |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What can I put from the clipboard?</strong></summary>


| Source Type          | Details |
|----------------------|---------|
| System Files/Folders | Files and folders copied using `yank-system-ops.nvim` or other applications (such as your OS's native file explorer) will be pasted into the current buffer's active directory.|
| Images               | An image copied to your clipboard from other applications or screenshot tools will be saved as a `.png` file in the current buffer's active directory. If you have SVG source code in your clipboard (e.g., from Lucide Icons or Figma assets), it will be saved as a `.svg` file.|
| Web URIs             | A file will be downloaded from the web URI and saved in the current buffer's active directory. Common file types are automatically detected (see next FAQ).|
| Archives             | 7z supported archive formats can be put as files or extracted to the current buffer's active directory. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What File Types are automatically detected with Web URI puts?</strong></summary>

These are some of the supported file types that are automatically detected when
putting web URIs. If the file type cannot be detected, the file will be saved
with a `.bin` extension:

| File Type | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Images    | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg` |
| Archives  | `.zip`  |
| Documents | `.pdf`  |
| Markup    | `.html`, `.xml`, `.json` |

You can [browse the download handler](https://github.com/Frosthaven/yank-system-ops.nvim/blob/main/lua/yank_system_ops/uri_downloader.lua)
to learn more.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does this add native clipboard support on multiple platforms?</strong></summary>

Each platform handles the system clipboard vastly different from one another. To
bridge this gap, `yank-system-ops.nvim` uses a combination of cli tools and
native OS commands to provide a consistent experience across platforms. Below is
a high-level overview of how each platform is supported:

- **Windows:** Relies on `powershell` commands to interact with the clipboard.
  _Note: Windows support is still being worked on._
- **MacOS:** Relies on `bash`, `osascript`, and `swift` scripts to interact
  with the clipboard.
- **Linux (Wayland):** Relies on `bash`, `wl-clipboard`, and `xclip` or `xsel`
  to interact with the clipboard.

By leveraging abstractions from these underlying tools and commands,
`yank-system-ops.nvim` can effectively interact with the system clipboard on
various operating systems, allowing users to seamlessly copy and paste files,
images, and URIs between Neovim and other applications.

In addition, `yank-system-ops.nvim` uses the `7zip` cli tool. Because it is
available on all major platforms, we can provide a consistent experience when
creating and extracting archives.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why did you make this?</strong></summary>

As a developer, I live in Neovim. The rest of the workforce does not.

I often found myself needing to quickly share files over Slack, Discord, email,
and other applications. Sometimes I'd need to point fellow developers to
specific lines in a GitHub repo. Other times I need to download project assets
from either Figma or an icon provider like Lucide Icons.

All of these tasks required me to leave Neovim, navigate to my file explorer,
and then find the file(s) I needed and do something with them like an animal.

Now I can just yank and put like a civilized human being.

## üìã Roadmap

- [x] Initial prototype
- [ ] Complete Windows support
- [ ] Complete Linux (X11) support
- [ ] Add setup opts for notifications, archive format, naming, etc.
- [ ] Add UI for narrowing file/folder selection when yanking/archiving
- [ ] Add buffer registry for runtime addition of buffer support
- [ ] Look into supporting tree-style file explorers
